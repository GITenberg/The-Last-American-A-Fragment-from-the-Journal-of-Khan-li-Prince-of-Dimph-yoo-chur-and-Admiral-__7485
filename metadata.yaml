description: "The Last American is a short future history novel by John Ames Mitchell\
  \ (1845–1918).\nFirst published in 1889, it is the fictional journal of a Persian\
  \ admiral named Khan-Li, who rediscovers America in 2951 by sailing across the Atlantic.\
  \ The world has been devastated, and North America virtually wiped out by climatic\
  \ changes, which had later reversed themselves. Civilization there was just beginning\
  \ to recover technologically (to the level of 1889). The book is, on the one hand\
  \ a satirical look at ways and customs of the United States as reconstructed from\
  \ the ruins and the Persians own spotty histories. It also seems to be a spoof of\
  \ the archaeological discoveries that were being made at the time. All of the Persians\
  \ have farcical names (Nōz-yt-ahl is the name of an historian, for example) and\
  \ often speak in breathless wonder at what they see. The overall language is archaic\
  \ in an odd sort of journalistic way.\nThe 1893 edition is a small hardcover book\
  \ with 78 numbered pages. It is illustrated with half- page etchings inserted into\
  \ the text and a few full-page etchings relating to the nearby text. One shows a\
  \ reconstructed street scene with \"costumes and manner of riding...taken from metal\
  \ plates now in the museum at Teheran\"; clearly indicating newspaper advertisements\
  \ from a print shop. Another, \"The Wooden God\", is a cigar store Indian; \"The\
  \ Ruins of the Great Temple\" shows a devastated Capitol Building.\nMontesquieu's\
  \ Persian Letters may have provided some degree of inspiration. In its own turn,\
  \ the book seems to have been a rough model for Aldous Huxley's Ape and Essence.\n\
